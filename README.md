## **Benefits**

1. **No Need for "Collect Files"**:

   - Unlike Collect Files, which creates a new folder every time, **Import+** organizes files directly into a single `(Footage)` folder in your project directory.
   - This ensures that your project remains clean and consistent without redundant folders.

2. **Eliminates Missing Footages**:

   - All your assets are copied to one location, reducing the risk of missing or broken file links.

3. **Seamless Integration**:

   - Import files directly from the ScriptUI panel without opening external file explorers.

4. **Relink with Ease**:
   - Automatically relink all existing project files to the newly organized `(Footage)` folder.
